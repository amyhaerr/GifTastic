# GifTastic (television shows)
Week 6 assignment of Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp

## Objective: 
To use the Giphy API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of television shows. To finish the work, one must call the Giphy API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.

## Other notes:
1. When the user clicks on a button, it will generate 10 static, non-animated specific television show gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the webpage.
2. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. 
3. When the image is clicked again, the gif will stop animating.
4. A rating and title are displayed above every gif image, which is provided by the GIPHY API.
5. There is a side box for adding a user television show to the buttons.
