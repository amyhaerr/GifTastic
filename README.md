# GifTastic (television shows)
Week 6 assignment of Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp

## Objective: 
To use the Giphy API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of television shows. To finish the work, one must call the Giphy API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.

## Other notes:
1. When the user clicks on a button, it will generate 10 static, non-animated specific television show gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the webpage.
2. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. 
3. When the image is clicked again, the gif will stop animating.
4. A rating and title are displayed below every gif image, which is provided by the GIPHY API.
5. There is a side box for adding a user television show to the buttons. 

## Technical Aspects:

1. Description of Problem:
    - To use GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates gifs of television shows.
2. How it was solved:
    - After countless hours of research, reviews of previous activities, study groups, tutor support, and TA support, I arrived at a working GifTastic web application.
    - It also took trial and error to get the buttons to populate in the correct location and launch the selected television show gifs.
